# General Guide: Configuring DNS Records for a Custom Domain

To point your custom domain (e.g., `baiq.tech.io`) to your web hosting service (like `manus.space`), you need to configure your domain's DNS (Domain Name System) records. This tells web browsers where to find your website when someone types your domain name into their address bar.

Here's a general step-by-step guide:

## Step 1: Access Your Domain Registrar's DNS Management

1.  **Log in** to your account with your domain registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, Google Domains, Cloudflare).
2.  Navigate to the **DNS management**, **Domain Management**, or **Advanced DNS** section for the specific domain you want to configure (`baiq.tech.io`). This section might be labeled differently depending on your registrar.

## Step 2: Identify Necessary Records from Your Hosting Provider

Your web hosting provider (in this case, `manus.space`) will provide you with the specific DNS records you need to set. These are typically:

*   **A Record (Address Record):** Maps your domain name to an IP address (e.g., `192.0.2.1`). This is used for the main domain (e.g., `baiq.tech.io`).
*   **CNAME Record (Canonical Name Record):** Maps an alias name to another canonical domain name. This is often used for subdomains like `www.baiq.tech.io` to point to your main domain or a hosting-provided URL.

For `manus.space`, you would typically be given a CNAME record to point your domain to the `manus.space` URL (e.g., `lswrsnah.manus.space`). You might also need an A record if `manus.space` provides a specific IP address for custom domains.

**Action:** Look for documentation or support articles from your hosting provider (`manus.space`) on 


how to configure a custom domain. They will specify whether to use an A record, CNAME record, or both, and what values to use.

## Step 3: Add or Modify DNS Records

Once you have the required records from your hosting provider, go back to your domain registrar's DNS management page and add/modify the records.

### For CNAME Records (Most common for platform-based hosting like `manus.space`):

1.  **Type:** Select `CNAME`.
2.  **Host/Name:**
    *   For `www.baiq.tech.io`, enter `www`.
    *   For the root domain `baiq.tech.io` (sometimes called `@` or your domain name), you might need to use a different method or an A record, as CNAMEs for root domains can be problematic. Some registrars offer a 


feature called "CNAME Flattening" or "ANAME" for root domains.
3.  **Value/Points to/Target:** Enter the URL provided by your hosting provider (e.g., `lswrsnah.manus.space`).
4.  **TTL (Time To Live):** This is how long DNS resolvers cache the information. A shorter TTL (e.g., 300 seconds or 5 minutes) means changes propagate faster, but it can increase DNS query load. A longer TTL (e.g., 3600 seconds or 1 hour) is common for stable records.

### For A Records (If your hosting provider gives you an IP address):

1.  **Type:** Select `A`.
2.  **Host/Name:**
    *   For `baiq.tech.io`, enter `@` (or leave it blank, depending on the registrar).
    *   For `www.baiq.tech.io`, you might create a separate A record for `www` or a CNAME pointing `www` to `@`.
3.  **Value/Points to/IP Address:** Enter the IP address provided by your hosting provider (e.g., `192.0.2.1`).
4.  **TTL:** Set as recommended by your hosting provider or a reasonable value.

## Step 4: Save Changes

After adding or modifying the records, make sure to **save** your changes. There might be a button like "Save Changes," "Add Record," or "Update DNS."

## Step 5: DNS Propagation

Once you save your DNS changes, it takes time for these changes to propagate across the internet. This process, known as DNS propagation, can take anywhere from a few minutes to 48 hours, though it's usually much faster (within a few hours).

*   You can use online tools (e.g., `dnschecker.org`) to check the propagation status of your DNS records.
*   During this time, some users might still see the old content or the old URL, while others will see the new one.

## Important Considerations:

*   **SSL/TLS Certificate:** Once your domain is pointing correctly, ensure your hosting provider issues and enables an SSL/TLS certificate for your custom domain. This is crucial for `https://` (secure) access to your website. Many modern hosting providers (like `manus.space` likely does) automatically handle this.
*   **Subdomains:** If you plan to use subdomains (e.g., `blog.baiq.tech.io`), you will need to create additional CNAME or A records for each subdomain.
*   **Email:** If you use custom email addresses with your domain (e.g., `info@baiq.tech.io`), ensure your MX (Mail Exchange) records are correctly configured. Changing A or CNAME records usually doesn't affect MX records, but it's good to verify.

If you encounter any issues, the best course of action is to contact the support team of your domain registrar or your web hosting provider for assistance.
